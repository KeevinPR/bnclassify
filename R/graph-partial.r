# # I could currently use undirected maybe
# 
# 
# # Partially directed graph with D and U edges
# ## Data
# - The to - from matrix
# - The edge_mode vector of same length as matrix rows
# 
# ## Funcs
# - add edge. does not add node
# - add arc. does not add node 
# 
# # Undirected
# 
# ## Funs
# - in_graph. used for discard reversed, for example, or similar.
# - compare_graphs
# 
# - subgraph.
# - direct tree. This is a point here.
