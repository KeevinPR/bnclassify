## R CMD check results   
On Appveyor there were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, and no NOTEs. 

Locally and on win-builder R-release there were no ERRORs or no NOTEs. There was one WARNING. 

hecking sizes of PDF files under ‘inst/doc’ ... WARNING
  ‘gs+qpdf’ made some significant size reductions:
     compacted ‘overview.pdf’ from 433Kb to 174Kb
  consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these files 

As far as I understand, the vignette is generated by the build from overview.Rmd and I don't how to force it to compress the resulting pdf. The four included graphics are pngs and take up 32K altogether. I get no avoid the warning if I use `devtools::check(args = '--as-cran', cran = TRUE, check_version = TRUE, build_args = c('--resave-data','--compact-vignettes="gs+qpdf"'))`. 

On travis ci, the above corresponded to a NOTE instead of a WARNING. There were not additional ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs. 

Finally, on win-builder R 3.5.0 there was an additional WARNING and XXXXX: 

The zip contents. No reason for overview.html
