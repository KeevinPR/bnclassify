## Test environments
* Ubuntu 16.04 3.4.4 (local)
* ubuntu 14.04 3.5.0 (travis ci)
* ubuntu 14.04 R-release (travis ci)
* windows R 3.5.0 (win-builder) 
* windows R-release (win-builder) 
* Windows i386-w64-mingw32/i386, R 3.5.0  (Appveyor)

## R CMD check results   
On Appveyor there were no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, and no NOTEs. 

Locally and on win-builder there were no ERRORs nor NOTEs. There was one WARNING. 

  Checking sizes of PDF files under ‘inst/doc’ ... WARNING
    ‘gs+qpdf’ made some significant size reductions:
       compacted ‘overview.pdf’ from 433Kb to 174Kb
    consider running tools::compactPDF(gs_quality = "ebook") on these files 

As far as I understand, the vignette is generated by the build from overview.Rmd and I don't how to force it to compress the resulting pdf. The four included graphics are pngs and take up 32K altogether. I get no warning locally if I use `devtools::check(args = '--as-cran', cran = TRUE, check_version = TRUE, build_args = c('--resave-data','--compact-vignettes="gs+qpdf"'))`.  

On travis ci there were no ERRORs nor WARNINGs. There was one NOTE. 

  checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is  8.4Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      doc    1.0Mb
      libs   6.9Mb
      
This was probably due to a -g compilation flag that I do not currently know how to remove. It does not occur in other environments.
